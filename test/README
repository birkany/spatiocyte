A simple and incomplete test for ecell3.


1. make and install ecell3.

   see ../INSTALL.

2. build Reactor dynamic module plugin

   % emtool reactor -c MichaelisUniUniReactor.cpp 
   % ls *.so
   MichaelisUniUniReactor.so

3. run ecell3

   The following command invokes ecell3, create Session instance, 
   load simple.eml and run 1000 seconds.

   % ecell3 testeml.py

   An example of output is as following; 
   Check Substance:/CELL/CYTOPLASM:S:Quantity is consumed.

   create a simulation session instance
   load Model
   Current time =  0.0
   Substance:/CELL/CYTOPLASM:S:Quantity    =       (1000000.0,)
   Substance:/CELL/CYTOPLASM:P:Quantity    =       (0.0,)
   Substance:/CELL/CYTOPLASM:E:Quantity    =       (1000.0,)
   Current time =  1000.00099998
   Reactor:/CELL/CYTOPLASM:E:ActivityPerSecond     =       (0.0,)
   Substance:/CELL/CYTOPLASM:S:Quantity    =       (0.0,)
   Substance:/CELL/CYTOPLASM:S:Concentration       =       (0.0,)
   Substance:/CELL/CYTOPLASM:S:Activity    =       (0.0,)
   Substance:/CELL/CYTOPLASM:S:Velocity    =       (-0.0,)
   Substance:/CELL/CYTOPLASM:P:Quantity    =       (1000000.0,)


4. Run gecell (osogo)

   Invoke gecell command.

   % gecell

   (1) File -> loadModel
   (2) select 'simple.eml'
   (3) Push 'EntryList' toggle button on the MainWindow
   (4) Push 'Palette' on the MainWindow
   (5) Push 'Tracer' in the Palette window
   (6) select CYTOPLASM in the system tree on the left of the EntryList window
   (7) select substances E, P and S by drugging over these entries
   (8) push 'start' button on the MainWindow
