== About ==

This is a model of the budding yeast cell cycle,
to be run on E-Cell Simulation Environment Version 3.
This model is based on the model introduced in the following publication.

K.C.Chen, A.Csikasz-Nagy, B.Gyorffy, J.Val, B.Novak, J.J.Tyson, 
"Kinetic Analysis of a Molecular Model of the Budding Yeast Cell Cycle",
Molecular Biology of the Cell, Vol.11:369-391, Jan 2000.

Presently, the simulation results of this model do not match those of 
the above publication's model. It can be suggested that there is an
intrinsic problem in the original model. We intend to further examine 
and identify the source of the behavioral differences in the near future.
