Spatiocyte runs on Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS X Yosemite systems. On a fresh
Ubuntu or a Mac OS X system, Spatiocyte requires several additional packages to
run. To install these packages and Spatiocyte, open a terminal and execute the
following instructions.

Ubuntu Linux:
$ ./install-spatiocyte-ubuntu.sh 

Mac OS X:
$ ./install-spatiocyte-mac.sh 

Enter your password when requested since some packages require the administrator
privilege to install. If you have any issues during install, post the error
messages to the Spatiocyte Users forum. On Mac, the installation script will
take a longer time to finish executing because more packages need to be
downloaded. We can use Blender to render simulation snapshots and VLC to view
movies of the snapshots. Since the installation script does not install them on
Mac, you can download and install them yourself from http://www.blender.org/
and http://www.videolan.org/.
